## SVG vs Canvas

**SVG ( Scalable Vector Graphics )**
- XML Syntax
- each shape is a DOM element
- pro : easy to get started and interactive with
- con : not performant at large scale

**HTML5 (Canvas)**
- JavaScript API
- One Canvas Element, Shape are inaccessable once drawn
- pro : very performance especially for animations
- con : hard to interact with

"SVG like a illustrator and Canvas is like Photoshop"
